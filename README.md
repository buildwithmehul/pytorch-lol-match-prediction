# PyTorch League of Legends Match Prediction üïπÔ∏è

This project is my **final submission for the Deep Learning with PyTorch course**.  
It uses match statistics (kills, deaths, assists, gold earned, etc.) to **predict the outcome of a League of Legends match** (Win/Loss) using a Logistic Regression model implemented in PyTorch.

## üìå Project Overview
- Implemented a **Logistic Regression model** from scratch using PyTorch.
- Applied **data preprocessing** (scaling, train-validation-test split).
- Trained the model using **Binary Cross Entropy with Logits Loss** and the **Adam optimizer**.
- Performed **hyperparameter tuning** with a simple grid search on learning rates.
- Evaluated the model with multiple metrics:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-score  
  - ROC AUC
